        <p>For the first activity, I chose number 3. Activity 3 talks about how to save a document, put files onto a USB, and how to create a file system on Windows. The reason I chose Activity 3 is that it's the most basic of all of the activities. I think a grandma could do this within minutes of using a computer. These Wikihows are also outdated, so modern systems can do their job better. Although these tutorials are really outdated, one of the things that the tutorial showed me was the backup and restore option. It’s still on Windows 11, though it is just labeled as Windows 7. I don’t really see a use for these, as I feel they are very basic, and I didn't really need the same knowledge thrown back at me again.</p>
        <p>For my second activity, I chose number 4. Activity 4 discusses how to use File systems for Windows, macOS, and Linux. I am pretty familiar with Windows and MAC, but Linux feels like it's doing WAY too much just to move one file. I know Linux is a superior OS compared to Windows and MAC, but seeing people do this would be mind-boggling to me. Still, these tutorials are outdated. Not to mention that the Linux OS has so many different versions that make it simpler to use. I don’t think I plan to use these tutorials, as I feel it's just common knowledge.</p>
        <p>For my last activity, I chose number 4. Activity 4 talks about IP addresses. Actually, I’m not sure what exactly it talks about for IP addresses. The article linked from that Activity can't be found, so I am kind of stumped as to what I should have learned from this activity. If I were to make a bold assumption, I would think the activity would want me to learn about what an IP address is and how to find my IP address from my device. I have actually done this before, as I have hosted private game servers with my friends so that they can join. Semi-related, but I also had to learn port-forwarding, using internet protocols like TCP and UDP. I think if I were to use this, it’d be for hosting websites, though I’d most likely do it on a cloud server, instead of having a hosted one from my computer.</p>
