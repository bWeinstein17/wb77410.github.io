            <p>For assignment 11, I was tasked with learning about Graphics and multimedia. This assignment has mainly wanted me to focus more on putting images on the website. During my work on assignment 10, I put a dog on the home page for learning about CSS. I have now decided to put a basic vector image on this page for assignment 11. Unfortunately, since Halloween was taking up most of my time, I wasn't able to learn a lot more about much. But I am happy to learn what I have already learned, and that means so much to me.</p>
