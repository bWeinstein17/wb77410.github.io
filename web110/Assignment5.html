    <h1>Assignment 5</h1>

        <p>For my first activity, I have chosen activity #1. Activity #1 requires you to browse through various social media sites and identify one that piques your interest. When first starting up this activity, I found not only 1, but multiple social media sites that piqued my interest. If I were to choose one, it would have to be the now-defunct Google+. Google+ was intended more for families than as a public media tool. Other than that, this was a nice little fun activity, though I wouldn't say it was really helpful, and I doubt I’d find a use for this anywhere.</p>
        <p>For my next activity, I have chosen activity #2. Activity #2 requires you to navigate through different social media platforms, sign up, and complete the necessary steps to use those platforms. I personally mainly use YouTube, Reddit, Snapchat, X (formerly known as Twitter), and Discord. I find these platforms teach you how to use them alone more efficiently than the guide the activity has given. Maybe if it were for seniors, then I’d consider it, but I really don't see a use for this activity outside.</p>
        <p>For my final activity, I have chosen activity #3. Activity #3 teaches you about the honeycomb model and wants you to study social media platforms that have such a model. When doing research, from what I know, almost all social media platforms have some sort of honeycomb model. I didn’t find any website that doesn’t use this said honeycomb model in the slightest. It feels like it is a necessity to have a honeycomb model in any social media platform. I’d recommend this to someone who wants to get into making a social media platform, but I don’t personally see myself using this.</p>
