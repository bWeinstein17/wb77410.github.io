For my first activity, I have chosen activity #1. Activity #1 makes you complete a tutorial on what Internet Services mean. Some of the services in Internet Services are Communication Services, Information Retrieval Services, World Wide Web, and Video Conferencing. I found it really Interesting, but also confusing, how these so-called services are grouped. I usually didn’t really mind thinking about it as its own separate thing. But now learning about the fact that they are all grouped, it makes my head hurt. I don’t really see myself using this information in the future. But if I did, I would break it down and make it its own thing, rather than it being 1.
For my next activity, I have chosen activity #3. Activity #3 makes you research the topic of remotely connecting to another computer. Remotely connecting to a computer usually requires 3rd party software in order to do so. I don’t do that much of remotely connecting to other computers, but I do use Steam Remote Play, which is a software that you can use to stream your games to another friend and play just like if you both were on a couch. The one downside of remotely connecting to another computer is that it is all reliant on your internet connection. If you have a terrible one, you aren't gonna have a great time. Other than that, I definitely would see myself using this in the future, if it's for streaming games to my friends, or helping them with their settings on their operating system.
For my final activity, I have chosen activity #5. Activity #5 makes you research piracy and intellectual property. Learning more about intellectual property, I have learned a few things about it that I find interesting, too. For starters, I did not know that copying music from a disk onto another disk is legal except if it is being used commercially. Another thing I found interesting is that sometimes downloading music from certain websites is illegal. I found this activity really fun to learn about, and would definitely suggest this to someone who wants to go into law. Overall, I would say I will keep this activity in mind.
