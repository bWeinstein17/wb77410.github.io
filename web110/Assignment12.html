            <p>For assignment 12, I have been tasked with learning JavaScript. JavaScript is another coding language that can be used for various purposes. For this activity, I was instructed to use it for HTML5. When learning about HTML5, it sparked a greater interest in coding for me. I really did enjoy using JavaScript, and could potentially use it for the future ahead of me. This very fun experience that I plan to come back to.</p>
