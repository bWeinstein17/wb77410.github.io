The first activity I have decided to do is activity #1. Activity #1 makes you complete a guide on how to use a search engine and browse the World Wide Web. It also shows you the advantages and disadvantages of using specific search engines. Personally, I don’t find anything useful in this that I already don’t know. However, this is a very good starting point for someone who wants to get into the internet. If there were a time when I would have to share information on how to use the internet, I think this would be the best activity for them.
The next activity I chose is activity #2. Activity #2 makes you compare different search engines. For this activity, I have chosen to use Bing and Google. As examples, I have searched up “who is the richest person in the world”, “coffee”, and “fruit”. The first result listed Elon Musk as the richest person on both engines, but Google also provided a list of individuals who are slightly less wealthy than him. The second result showed a map of where coffee shops can be near me on Google, but on Bing, it shows what the definition of coffee means. Funnily enough, the Bing results for coffee actually hide a little bit of information stating that the definition of coffee has been AI-generated and can be inaccurate. For my last result, Google showed me an AI overview of the definition for fruit, though, unlike Bing, Google points out that it is AI-generated. Bing, however, shows you the Wikipedia definition of the word fruit with other hyperlinks that can automatically search for other things related to fruit for you. For instance, there is a tab that says “Flavors”. When clicked, it searches for “Flavors of fruits” and refreshes the page, giving you the desired results. I personally use Bing due to it having Microsoft points you can use, but I wish Microsoft were more up front with search results being AI-generated.
The final activity I have decided to choose is activity #4. Activity #4 is just a simple tutorial on how to check if your website is on Google's index. It uses the wikiversity website as an example, and all you have to do is type site:\\ then put in your website. Once you do, you will see if it is on there or not. I don’t really have much to say about this activity except that it is very basic. However, on the bright side, it is very useful to website developers who wanna double double-check if their website is live. I personally don’t see myself using this in the future, but I would 100% see other people using this for moderating a site.
