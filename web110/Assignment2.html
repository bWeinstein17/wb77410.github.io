            <p>The first activity I did was activity 1. Activity 1 discusses the basics of browsing the World Wide Web, from selecting your browser to saving web elements. Some of the things I found interesting are that there are paid emails that sort out spam for you. I think this would be a great tutorial for people who want to learn how to browse the World Wide Web, although I personally don't believe I’d use this tutorial. Even if it was a grandparent, which, granted, should not be on the internet at all. Because, while being related to the activity, my grandma decided to go on an ad from Facebook and put her credit card details in. I looked into the website, and it was created a few months ago. That's when she had to cancel her card and never went on the web again.</p>
            <p>The next activity I did was activity 2. Activity 2 just wants you to review the guides for each browser to install them and prepare yourself, and compare the programs. I didn’t really find that much to compare, except for Brave being a more secure web browser than the other types of browsers. One thing I like about these browsers is that they sync over to other devices. I never really knew that browsers had a feature like that nowadays. I personally prefer using Brave, as it is the least bloated of all the other browsers. I could definitely see myself using this.</p>
            <p>The last activity I chose was activity 4. Activity 4 goes into how each browser works from the other. I found this pretty interesting, as almost all of these browsers contain some sort of AI chatbot. The only one I didn't find myself liking was Opera. Opera contains so many unnecessary things that it's super overwhelming. Overall, I’d rather stick to Brave, as it just does its job better than the other browsers. But if people wanted a more immersive experience, then I’d see no reason not to pick Opera up.</p>
