            <p>For assignment 9, I had to update my website with HTML coding. I really had a lot of fun with this and wanted to share my experience with you. I really enjoyed the trial and error coding has brought to me and sparked my interest in coding as a whole. I also think it is pretty cool how there is a validator for websites so that people can refine their coding to be more optimized for browsers. I forgot how glorious HTML was, and I think just the coding of it alone would get me to places unforeseen.</p>
