    <h1>Assignment 8</h1>
    <body>
        <p>For my first activity, I have chosen activity #1. Activity #1 makes you complete tutorials on Internet safety and Internet security. This is a great activity for people who want to get into the World Wide Web. One of the main takeaways from this is the danger the internet can pose and how to identify certain issues that may affect your device. I also found it interesting that it brought up Adobe Flash Player, which is pretty ancient at the time. Overall, I think this is an excellent activity for people who want to use the internet but also want to know the dangers that lie ahead.</p>
        <p>For my next activity, I have chosen activity #2. Activity #2 makes you go over different browsers' privacy settings to match your personal preferences. For this activity, I decided to mainly use Brave. I personally find Brave to be one of the best browsers out there when talking about security and bloat. One thing I like about Brave is that it has not only the ability to block ads, but also the ability to block trackers as well. I think this activity is great for people who want to know the pros and cons of which browser has better privacy settings, and I think I would use this in the future.</p>
        <p>For my last activity, I have chosen activity #3. Activity #3 talks about different types of antivirus software for your computer. I personally believe that Windows Security, the default antivirus that comes pre-installed with Windows 11, is the best antivirus out there, if you know not to click on suspicious links or download files without scanning them. Windows Security can also do a full-fledged offline file scan, something that other antivirus software can’t do, mainly because they require the internet to validate your license. Overall, I don’t see much use for this activity, but if someone wanted to get into using a computer, this would be the first thing I’d show them.</p>
