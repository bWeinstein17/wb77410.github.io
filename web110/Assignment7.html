For my first activity, I have chosen activity #1. Activity #1 requires you to complete a tutorial on Internet Reference Models, Internet Protocols, and the Internet Domain Name System. I really enjoyed learning more about what lies beyond the internet. One of the things I learned more about was UDP. I personally only used TCP and UDP for port forwarding on my router to get an open network connection, but learning more about what both actually do peaked my interest. I will definitely be using this information in the future for certain.
For my next activity, I have chosen activity #2. Activity #2 talks about Essential Wi-Fi settings and the ipconfig command prompt. There were so many interesting things to look at for this activity. I already knew about some of the functionality behind the ipconfig command for the command prompt, so it wasn't much new information to me. However, it did spark my curiosity about the usefulness of the command prompt. I could see myself using this information in the future, but only a small portion of it.
For my final activity, I have chosen activity #3. Activity #3 makes you verify what type of internet connection you have. There wasn't that much information that I didn't already know about taking away from this activity. I really did like the fact that it brings up the Windows command prompt again, but that was the only thing interesting about it. Another thing I liked was that it brought up the ping command, which is a very useful command to test out your ping. I definitely liked this activity, and there is some information that I could use in the future.
