            <p>The first activity I have chosen is activity #1. Activity #1 gives you a tutorial on how to use Email. The activity also goes into the proper way you should be emailing specific groups of people, either business or casual. I already knew about some of the things that were mentioned in the tutorial, but if I were to choose one that I just learned, it would be creating contacts and turning off receiving emails. I think the tutorial that was given is a very good starting point for people who want to get into the internet, but personally, I don’t really see a use for it.</p>
            <p>The next activity I have chosen is activity #2. Activity #2 goes into how to actually send and respond to an email. The tutorial also shows you how to put in a subject and a signature for your email. There is not much from this very interesting tutorial, other than what I mentioned. If I were to give this activity to a grandparent, then yes, it would be quite helpful for them. I didn’t really find anything interesting from this activity, as it is pretty basic from all the rest of them. Overall, because of this, I don’t really see much of a use for coming back to this tutorial, as it is the number 1 thing you should learn about when using the Internet.</p>
            <p>Finally, the last activity I have chosen is activity #5. Activity #5 goes over internet mailing and bulk emails, and what they are. The activity also wants you to send one of each email; however, all the options for sending and receiving those kinds of emails are at a price point. I looked through the definition, and I personally don't see a use for any of these. Getting a list of emails and sending emails to a large group of recipients seems like you're trying to be a scammer. I don’t really see myself, nor plan to use this in the future, as it seems like a waste of time.</p>
