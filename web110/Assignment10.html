            <p>For Assignment 10, I was tasked with learning CSS for the website I am building. CSS is an important part of building a website using HTML. Initially, learning this was challenging. But the more I went into it, the more it started making sense to me. Some struggles I had were resizing an image to fit on a screen. Other than that, doing everything else with CSS was pretty fun, and I had a great time learning it. Personally, learning how to make a website has really helped me with my future career, and I hope one day I might be able to use this knowledge for the future.</p>
